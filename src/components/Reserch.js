                <h3>Prof. Amir Ayali. Insect Behavior, Neuroethology & Bio-inspiration</h3>
                <span>
                    Amir Ayali received his PhD from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1995. He went on to become a postdoctoral fellow at the Section of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University.    In 1999 he returned to Israel and started his own group at the Department of Zoology, Tel Aviv University, where he also served as Department Chair between 2011 and 2015. His research interests span from insect behavior and neural mechanisms for behavior to bio-inspired technological innovations.      (Brief CV - PDF)
